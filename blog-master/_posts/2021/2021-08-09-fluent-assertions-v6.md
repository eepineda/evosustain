**Update August 22th, 2021:** 6.1 was shipped with important performance fixes and a version of FluentAssertions.JSON compatible with v6 was also released.

## A true story
Once upon a time in a small country called The Netherlands, a little open-source project was born. It must have been 2008 and open-source in the .NET community was still in its infancy. CodePlex was still a thing and NuGet did not exist yet. Fast-forward to 2021 and this little project has attracted [more than 100 million downloads](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentAssertions/) and is being used in [more projects](https://nugetmusthaves.com/Dependency/FluentAssertions) than I can keep track off. 

But almost 1.5 year before that, on January 4th, 2020, me and my partner-in-crime [Jonas Nyrup](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnyrup/) started to work on our next major release. We got support by about 20 contributors, with special thanks to [Lukas Grutzmacher](https://github.com/lg2de) and [Michaël Hompus](https://github.com/eNeRGy164), as well as sponsors [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) and [Cristian Quisoj](https://github.com/cquirosj). Now, after [570 commits](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/compare/5.10.3...master) affecting 626 files, two alphas and three betas, it's time to let Fluent Assertions 6 enter the real-world. Let me provide you with the highlights of this release.

## Time to break with the past (again)
A bump of the major part of the release number [implies](https://semver.org/) breaking changes, and 6.0 is no different. Given that opportunity, one of the first things we do with any major release is to review the supported frameworks. We now support .NET Framework 4.7, .NET Core 2.1, .NET Core 3.0, .NET Standard 2.0 and 2.1, and although there's no special support for it, that also means we support .NET 5. We did however drop support for .NET Framework 4.5, .NET Standard 1.3 and 1.6. In a similar fashion, we reviewed the test frameworks we support as well. This resulted in us dropping support for the first version of MSTest, NSpec v1 and 2, xUnit 1, Gallio and MBUnit. 

Given a major release bump, we also took the opportunity to review some of our design decisions from the past. One of them is the way we supported `async` code. In the past, we would invoke asynchronous code by wrapping it in a synchronously blocking call. Unfortunately this resulted in occasional deadlocks, which we fixed by temporarily clearing the `SynchronizationContext`. This worked but felt like an ugly workaround. So in v6, we decided to fully embrace asynchronous code and make some of the assertion APIs async itself. This means that using `Should().Throw()` will [no longer](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1324) magically work on `async` code and you need to use `ThrowAsync()` instead. 

Another design change that we thought the time is right for, was the [removal](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1529) of support for non-generic collections. I mean, why would anybody still want to use an `ArrayList`, right? Nonetheless, for those that can't let go of this ancient type, we documented a workaround in our [migration guide](https://fluentassertions.com/upgradingtov6). 

## A shipload of changes
Although Fluent Assertions was already quite feature complete, v6 still adds some new capabilities such as [support](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1543) for `BufferedStream`, `TaskCompletionSource`, [first-class support](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1479) for `enum`s [and](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1298) `IReadOnlyDictionary<K, V>`. But that's not all, here's a summary of all other less important changes. 

To ease assertions on exceptions coming from code returning a `Task`, we've [added](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1362) an `async` version of `Where` to further refine what you were expecting, like this:

`await act.Should().ThrowAsync<ArgumentException>().Where(i => i.Message == "That was wrong.");`

And in case you want to assert that an exception with specific characterics is not throw, `NotThrow()`, `NotThrowAsync()`, `NotThrowAfter()` and `NotThrowAfterAsync()` [now](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1289) allow chaining using the `Which` extension. For specific cases, such as the `ArgumentException`, you can also use the new `WithParameterName()` method. 

`act.Should().ThrowExactly<ArgumentNullException>().WithParameterName("interfaceType")`;

The already pretty complete set of assertions available for strings has been extended as well. For instance, you can [now assert](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1357) the lower or upper casing of strings using `BeUpperCased()` or `BeLowerCased()` and their negated counterparts. A more [subtle change](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1413) is how `StartWith()`, `EndWith()` and the `EquivalentOf()` versions allow an empty string as the expecation. And talking about that last category of methods, `StartWithEquivalent()` has been [renamed](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1292) to `StartWithEquivalentOf()`, just like `EndWithEquivalent()`. Also, the methods `MatchRegex()` and its inverse counterpart [now take](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1436) an entire `Regex` object in addition to the regex string it took before. This should give you a bit more flexibility when you need it. 

But we've also changed the semantics of string comparisons related to the culture of the test environment. 
We believe that unit tests should behave the same no matter the culture of the machine being run on, so as of v6, [we internally use](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1283) `StringComparison.Ordinal` and `OrdinalIgnoreCase` for string comparisons. And in case you're dealing with a collection of strings, you [can use](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1246) `NotContainMatch()` to assert that the collection does not contain a string that matches a wildcard pattern, and `AllBe()` to assert that [all strings](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1332) in collection are equal to the specified string. 

If the collection involved deals with anything else than strings, we still have plenty to offer. For example, `Satisfy()` will allow you to compare a collection with a set of predicates while ignoring the exact order. `BeInAscendingOrder()` and `BeInDescendingOrder()` now take a lambda as a predicate. And `NotContainInOrder()` [allow you](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1339) to assert that the collection does not contain the specified elements in the exact same order, not necessarily consecutive. And for the more complicated cases, you [can use](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1318) `NotContainEquivalentOf` to assert the absence of an element in the collection using the same engine as `BeEquivalentTo` uses. 
	
Date and time support got some minor adjustments. For instance, [we added](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1427) nullable overloads to `Be()` and `NotBe()`, applicable to both `DateTime` as well as `DateTimeOffset`. And to simplify the creation of the latter, you can [now use](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1235) the new `WithOffset()` extension method to chain on a `DateTime` such as returned by the date/time fluent API like `31.January(2021)`. By the way, [we decided](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1278) to change `int`-based precision parameters to take a `TimeSpan`.
	
Although the `event` keyword is becoming a lost art in C# world, we still support it. In v6, we fixed some bugs and cleaned up the API. For instance, `WithSender()` and `WithArgs()` will [only return](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1321) the events that match the constraints. And several of the APIs will return an `IEventRecording` instead of `IEventRecorder`. This allowed us to make `EventMonitor` and `RecordedEvent` `internal` and make the entire API a bit more cleaner.
	
On the reflection front, several [new members](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1329) were added to help filter types and members returned by the `Types()` method before asserting they have certain characteristics. Examples of these include `ThatAreClasses()` and `ThatAreNotClasses()`, or `ThatAreStatic()` and `ThatAreNotStatic()`. But if you need more flexibility then you can use `ThatSatisfy(Func<Type, bool> predicate)`. If the involved types are `IEnumerable<T>` or `Task<T>`, you can use `UnwrapEnumerableTypes()` or `UnwrapTaskTypes()` to extract the generic types and continue with those. 

Given you've selected the types you're interested in, you can now run assertions like `Should().NotBeSealed()`, `BeSealed()`, `BeInNamespace()` and `NotBeUnderNamespace()`. You could already get the `Methods()` and `Properties()` from whatever your type selection returned, but you can now also get the `ReturnTypes()`. For methods, you can use `Be()` and `NotBe()` to ensure a method has a certain access modifier. And finally, for properties, you can [ensure](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1269) they are not writable using `NotBeWritable()`. Since we were allowed to introduce breaking changes, we [removed](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1221) some obsoleted members, including `HasAttribute()`, `HasMatchingAttribute()` and `IsDecoratedWith(Type, bool)`. 

## Structural equivalency assertions
Fluent Assertions' flagship feature has always been the ability to do a [deep recursive comparison](https://fluentassertions.com/objectgraphs/) between two object graphs. In v6, a lot has changed, both on the outside as well as on the internals. 

We'll cover the internals when I discuss extensibility, but let's start with the changes you may care about, in particular our most popular request, support for C# 9.0's `records` We had extensive [open discussions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1451) on what would be the most logical behavior, but ultimately [settled](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1571) on comparing records by their members, just like we do with classes and anonymous types. Of course, you can easily override this by using the `ComparingByValue<T>`, `ComparingByMembers<T>`, `ComparingRecordsByValue` and `ComparingRecordsByMembers`, including a [new overload](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1389) that takes an open-generic type. And since it wasn't always obvious what logic Fluent Assertions would use for what type of object, it will now include information on how tuples, anonymous types, records and other types are compared in the failure message.

In addition to that, `BeEquivalentTo` now knows how to compare properties or fields pointing to a `XDocument`, `XElement` and `XAttribute`, as well as various `System.Data` types (`DataSet`, `DataTable`, `DataColumn`, `DataRow`, `DataRelation`, `Constraint`). And to reuse the logic to compare certain types of objects across your code-base, [there's a](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1284) `Using<T>` version that takes an `IEqualityComparer<T>` 

On the behavioral side, `BeEquivalentTo` will [no longer](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1575) include `internal` properties and fields, unless `IncludingInternalProperties` or `IncludingInternalFields` is used. We also [restricted](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1494) what types `WhenTypeIs<T>` can use and how `Using<T>` handles non-nullable types (which is explained in the [Migration Guide](https://fluentassertions.com/upgradingtov6)). And talking about the `Using`/`When` combo, `When` will [now](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1257) use the conversion rules when trying to match the predicate. Oh, and auto-conversion [will use](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1283) `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` instead of `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture` when applicable.

## Reporting & Usability
In the category of less mindblowing improvements, v6 contains several reporting and usability refinements. Here are a couple of highlights.

* [Improved](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1619) formatting of predicates.
* [Much smarter](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1435) parsing of your code to report the variable names in your assertion.
* [Included](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1504) the milliseconds part for error messages that involve a `TimeSpan`.
* [Added](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1469) the possibility to set the maximum depth and other formatting settings either globally or per `AssertionScope`. This solves some of the reported performance problems that some folks have experienced with deep object graphs. 
* [Changed](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1418) `AttributeBasedFormatter` so you can build more specific formatters that get precendence over more generic ones.
* [Improved](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1333) the message that `RaisePropertyChangeFor` throws when a property changed event was raised for the wrong property. 
* Requesting an unsupported test framework via `Services.Configuration.TestFrameworkName` or the `FluentAssertions.TestFramework` setting [now](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1366) throws an exception instead of using the fallback.
* [Renamed](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1581) `WhichValue` to `WhoseValue` to make it read in a more natural way like

	`dictionary.Should().ContainKey("Key").WhoseValue.Should().Be(4);`

* [Added](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1433) overload of the `Enumerating` extension method to be able to force the enumeration of an object's member like this:

	`obj.Enumerating(x => x.SomeMethodThatUsesYield("blah")).Should().Throw<ArgumentException>();`

## Extensibility
Unless you've been building your own extensions, you can safely skip this paragraph. But if you do, there's a couple of nice improvements that may help you in the future:

* Added an `AddReportable` overload to `AssertionScope` for deferring reportable value calculation until a test failure. This has helped improve performance for the rest of the library.
* In a chained assertion API call, a second call to `ForCondition` [should not](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1587) evaluate its lambda when the previous assertion failed.
* `Formatter.ToString()` and `IValueFormatter` [now work](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1469) with a `FormattingOptions` object that wraps the `UseLineBreaks` option and some of the new settings for limiting the depth.
* [Added](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1341) `ForConstraint` method to `AssertionScope` that allows you to use an `OccurrenceConstraint` in your custom assertion extensions that can verify a number against a constraint, e.g. as is done [here](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/blob/master/Src/FluentAssertions/Primitives/StringAssertions.cs#L844) in `StringAssertions`.
* [Ensured](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1325) that `Given` will no longer evaluate its predicate if the preceding `FailWith` raised an assertion failure 

Since this a major release, we took the opportunity to apply some significant refactoring to the internal APIs. For example, we [split-up](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1539) the subject and expectation from the `IEquivalencyValidationContext` interface into a new type `Comparands`. This obviously affected the `IEquivalencyStep` and its implementations, but we didn't stop there. We also [moved](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1539) the responsibility of `IEquivalencyStep.CanHandle` into `Handle` and replaced `Handle`'s boolean return value with a more clearer `EquivalencyResult`. And while we were at it, we've [moved](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1588) all implementations to the `FluentAssertions.Equivalency.Steps` namespace and [renamed](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/pull/1539) `EquivalencyStepCollection` to `EquivalencyPlan`. Then we started removing a lot more members from the `IEquivalencyValidationContext` interface by [moving](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1379) them into a hierarchy of `INode` interfaces as well as the new `Reason` and `Tracer` classes. This affected the `IMemberMatchingRule`, `IMemberSelectionRule` and `IOrderingRule` and forced us [to replace](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/issues/1379) their dependency on `SelectedMemberInfo` to `INode` and its derivatives `IMember`, `IField` and `IProperty`. But don't be afraid, all the documentation has been properly updated. We even threw in a migration guide for those that run into common upgrade issues.
