    <h1>London-born startup aims to improve efficiency and transform urban waste collection logistics with global potential</h1>

    <p><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong></p>

    <p>
        EvoSustain, a startup founded in London, is developing an innovative approach to improve efficiency and transform
        the logistics of waste and recycling collection in cities through the use of technology, data analysis and smarter
        operational planning.
    </p>

    <p>
        The initiative focuses on addressing one of the major challenges faced by modern urban environments: managing waste
        efficiently while reducing operational costs and environmental impact. The project aims to optimise collection routes,
        improve operational visibility and reduce emissions associated with waste transport logistics.
    </p>

    <p>
        The idea behind EvoSustain emerged from direct observation of operational inefficiencies within the waste management
        sector in south London, where many processes were still handled manually, including paper-based routing for drivers,
        limited real-time tracking and fragmented communication between operational teams.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “Cities are becoming increasingly complex, and essential services like waste collection need smarter systems to
        improve efficiency and sustainability,” said Edwin Pineda Carrasco, founder of EvoSustain.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The project is currently in the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase and has been designed with scalability in mind.
        While it was born in London, the long-term ambition is to develop solutions that could be applied across cities
        nationally and globally, supporting more sustainable and efficient urban environments.
    </p>
