    <h1>EvoSustain Launches Smart Waste Logistics Platform to Transform Urban Sustainability</h1>

    <p><strong>London, UK — March 2026</strong></p>

    <p>
        EvoSustain, a UK-based cleantech startup focused on digital transformation in the waste management sector,
        today announced the development of its intelligent logistics platform designed to improve efficiency,
        transparency, and sustainability across urban waste collection operations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The platform integrates real-time data analytics, route optimization, and operational visibility tools
        to help waste operators, municipalities, and commercial partners reduce operational costs and carbon emissions
        while improving service performance.
    </p>

    <h2>Addressing a Critical Industry Challenge</h2>

    <p>
        Waste collection logistics remains one of the least digitized segments within urban infrastructure.
        Many organizations still rely on fragmented communication, manual scheduling, and limited data visibility.
        EvoSustain aims to bridge this gap through modern cloud-based technology and intelligent automation.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “Cities need smarter systems to manage resources efficiently and sustainably. Our mission is to provide
        technology that empowers organizations to make better operational decisions while reducing environmental impact,”
        said Edwin Pineda, Founder of EvoSustain.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Innovation Through Data and Collaboration</h2>

    <p>
        Currently in its Proof of Concept (PoC) phase, EvoSustain is actively collaborating with industry partners
        to validate the platform in real operational environments. The company’s roadmap includes expanding
        capabilities into predictive analytics, compliance tracking, and ESG reporting tools.
